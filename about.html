                <h1>What is this tool?</h1>
                <p class="about-text">The Average Grade Calculator is designed to help students easily keep track of
                   their academic performance. This tool allows users to input various types of
                   assessments such as exams, quizzes, pop quizzes, midterms, and projects. By 
                   entering the scores for each of these items, students can get a comprehensive
                   overview of their grades and understand how they are performing across 
                   different assignments.</p>
                <p class="about-text">Using the calculator is straightforward. Users simply select an item from the
                   provided list and input its corresponding score, which should be between 1 and
                   100. Upon pressing the 'Calculate' button, the app generates a detailed table
                   that displays each item, the respective score, and the letter grade associated
                   with that score. The grading scale ranges from A++ to F, providing clear and
                   precise feedback on each entered score.</p>
                <p class="about-text">Additionally, the Average Grade Calculator computes the total average of all
                   entered scores and determines the final letter grade based on this average.
                   This final result not only helps students see their overall performance but
                   also indicates whether they have passed the course. With this tool, students
                   can easily monitor their progress and identify areas that may need improvement,
                   ensuring they stay on track with their academic goals.</p>
